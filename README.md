                    SSEalign Version 1.1 - Usage Guide
                 ===========================================

1. Prerequisites for SSEalgin

1.1 Linux platform

1.2 Perl package

1.3 SSpro8 software

1.4 Dynamic programming algorithm package


2. Detail of the required tools
  
2.1 Linux platform

SSEalign package should be compatible with any Linux operating system. If a problem occurs during the installation or if SSEalign is not running properly, please read the information reported below about the possible problems.
  
2.2 Perl package

The scripts in SSEalign are written in Perl. These scripts assume Perl is installed in the default location for linux operating systems: /usr/bin/perl If Perl is not installed in this folder of your system, please create a symlink to your Perl installation in /usr/bin.  
  
2.3 SSpro8 software

The SSpro8 software is a tool for prediction of protein secondary structure and can be download in http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/. Other tools for protein secondary structure, such as JPRED4 and PsiPred, are also acceptable, but their results will not be not as good as SSpro8.

2.4 Dynamic programming algorithm package

The package of Dynamic programming algorithm package is recommended to download in https://github.com/noporpoise/seq-align. Please make sure to configure this package and add the path into the file .bashrc before using SSEalign. For example, if the path of folder seq-align is '/home/yang/seq-align', then you need to add a script into the file '.bashrc'. Please don't forget to re-execute the .bashrc file before using. 

export PATH=$PATH:/home/yang/seq-align/bin

The EMBOSS tool is also acceptable for dynamic programming algorithm but the file size is much large. 

2.5 other suggestions

Note also that the 'tmp' folders in the package must not be removed or renamed as they are used by the various tools to store intermediate files during a run. Temporary files are removed after each run and several instances of SSEalign can run simultaneously.

3. Testing SSEalign usage

To test the usage of SSEalign, please change directory to SSEalign storage area and run SSEalign on the provided example datasets. if it runs with no errors, means that the SSEalign has been installed successfully.
